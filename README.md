# ro61n-Binance-Trading-Bot-Algorithm-NodeJS
A concept server-side quantitative algorithm that runs 24/7 and works together with a Client App interface.

The main (index) file is "_main.js".

This algorithm is controlled by a quantitative model which gives instructions to open and close long and short positions based on real time market conditions. The server-side algorithm is a Node.js application.

This algorithm can manage all the binance accounts of users who sign up with the React Native interface. It would access users' accounts with their API keys and apply the same algorithm (decisions) to every account.

This repository looks busy as the goal was to experiment with it in many ways on a trial and error basis instead of creating a neat and planned final product.
